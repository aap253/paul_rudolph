      <p>
        Paul Rudolph (1918-1997) was a visionary American architect known for his bold, modernist designs and innovative use of materials, particularly reinforced concrete. 
        A leading figure in the <i>Brutalist</i> movement, Rudolph gained fame as the chair of Yale's School of Architecture and for designing the iconic Yale Art & Architecture Building. 
        His work is characterized by dramatic sculptural forms, complex spatial arrangements, and unique interpretation of light and texture. <br><br>
        
        One of his most iconic works, the Yale Art and Architecture Building (1963), stands as a defining example of Brutalism, with its rugged concrete surfaces and interlocking spaces.
        Rudolph’s later projects, such as the Government Service Center in Boston and the Burroughs Wellcome Headquarters in North Carolina, further demonstrated his mastery of material and form, 
        creating visually striking yet functional spaces. <br><br>
      
        Some of his other notable projects include the Government Service Center in Boston and Milam Residence in Florida.
        Despite controversy over his raw, expressive style and Brutalism falling out of favor in the late 20th century, Rudolph's impact is ostensibly groundbreaking and influential, inspiring generations of designers succeeding him.

      <h2>LOMEX</h2>
      <p style="padding:0%;">Collaborating with Robert Moses, Paul Rudolph envisioned an illustrious scope for Lower Manhattan Expressway (LOMEX) in the 1940s. He created detailed multi-level megastructures that 
        with a 10-lane elevated expressway connecting the Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges to the Holland Tunnel. His goal was to integrate <i>residential</i>, <i>commercial</i>, and <i>transportation</i> elements. His radical proposal envisioned the expressway as part of a self-contained urban complex with pedestrian
        walkways, housing, and green spaces, attempting to blend infrastructure with the city rather than divide it.
      </p>
      <p style="padding:0%;">Rudolph’s version of LOMEX, though never built, reflected his broader architectural vision—layered, dynamic spaces that sought to humanize large-scale urban systems. His ambitious ideas for 
        multi-use, high-density environments, which complimented Moses’ often rigid, car-dominated approach to city planning. The project was heavily backed by Moses and received federal funding approval, but it faced growing
        resistance from local residents, preservationists, and activists, including urbanist Jane Jacobs (see quote below.)
      </p>
      <p style="padding:0%;">Today, SoHo and surrounding areas, which would have been drastically altered or erased, thrive as cultural and commercial hubs, standing as a testament to the successful resistance against the expressway’s construction.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><i>"The architects, planners—and businessmen–are seized with dreams of order, and they have become fascinated with scale models and bird’s-eye views. This is a vicarious way to deal 
          with reality, and it is, unhappily, symptomatic of a design philosophy now dominant: buildings come first, for the goal is to remake the city to fit an abstract concept of what, logically, 
          it should be."</i> – Jane Jacobs (1916-2006), urban activist</p>
